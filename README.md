# Big-Mart-Sales-Data-Cleaning-Python-Script


Welcome to the real-world data cleaning using Python and pandas.  
This is where I learned that **raw data is just the beginning**, and how powerful even a few lines of cleaning code can be in making messy Excel files analysis-ready.

## 📦 Project Summary

- **📁 File:** `project_1.py`  
- **📊 Dataset:** `Big_mart.xlsx` (Retail sales data)  
- **🎯 Goal:** Clean and prepare the raw data for further analysis or machine learning

## 🧠 The Data Cleaning Process (Step by Step)

###  1. Reading the Raw Data

- I loaded the Excel sheet using pandas, setting the stage for transformation.
  

###  2. Handle Missing Values
- Filled missing Item_Weight values with the median
- Filled unknown Outlet_Size entries with "NA"
  

###  3. Fix Invalid and Inconsistent Values
- Replaced 0s in Item_Visibility with its median
- Categorized Item_Visibility into "Low" and "High"
- Standardized values in Item_Fat_Content like "LF" → "Low Fat", "reg" → "Regular"
  

###  4. Round Off Numeric Columns
- Rounded values in Item_MRP, Item_Outlet_Sales, and Item_Visibility for cleaner representation and better readability.


###  5. Export the Cleaned Dataset
- Saved the final cleaned data into a new CSV file for further use like modeling, analysis, or dashboard building.


### What’s Next?
With this clean dataset, we can:
- Build dashboards in Power BI/Tableau 
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
- Train machine learning models 
- Discover sales trends and customer patterns
